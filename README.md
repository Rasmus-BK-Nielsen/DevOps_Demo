# DevOps_Demo

## Creating the app, step by step:
### Setting up git
echo "# DevOps_Demo" >> README.md  
git init  
git add README.md  
git commit -m "first commit"  
git branch -M main  
git remote add origin https://github.com/Rasmus-BK-Nielsen/DevOps_Demo.git  
git push -u origin main  

### Creating the frontend
npx create-react-app devops_frontend  
(Delete most of the autogenerated code)

### Creating Dockerfiles for frontend
Created two files .Dev for development and .Prod for deployment  
Both files are accompanied with a startup file  
which is made executeable with: chmod +x filename.sh (cd devops_frontend)  
to make the containers synchronised with gitHub

### Building and running the Containers
docker build -t my-app-production -f Dockerfile.Prod .  
This builds the production container, and names it: my-app-production

docker run -p 80:80 --name my-app-production-container my-app-production  
This runs the Docker image of the same name, and opens up port 80 for acces  

docker build -t my-app-development -f Dockerfile.Dev .  
This builds the development container, and manes it: my-app-development  

docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ${PWD}:/app --name my-app-development-container my-app-development  
This runs the Docker image. The ${PWD}:/app variable  
makes the host machines directory accessable through the container, such  
that any changes to the current directory, is visible inside the container, and vice versa.
