# DevOps_Demo

## Creating the app, step by step:
### Setting up git
echo "# DevOps_Demo" >> README.md  
git init  
git add README.md  
git commit -m "first commit"  
git branch -M main  
git remote add origin https://github.com/Rasmus-BK-Nielsen/DevOps_Demo.git  
git push -u origin main  

### Creating the frontend
npx create-react-app devops_frontend  
(Delete most of the autogenerated code)

### Creating Dockerfiles for frontend
Created two files .Dev for development and .Prod for deployment  
Both files are accompanied with a startup file  
which is made executeable with: chmod +x filename.sh (cd devops_frontend)  
to make the containers synchronised with gitHub
